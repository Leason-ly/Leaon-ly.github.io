ABOUT ME
------

👔 I am a PhD student in [School of Computer Science and Technology]([https://cs.fudan.edu.cn/]), [Fudan University]([https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/]) under the supervision of Prof. [Bihuan Chen]([https://chenbihuan.github.io/]) and Prof. [Xin Peng]([https://cspengxin.github.io/]), mentored by Prof. Bihuan Chen. I received my bachelor degree in software engineering from [Soochow University]([http://eng.suda.edu.cn/]) in 2022.


🌱 I currently major in software engineering and my research interests AI systems engineering, automatic driving system and simulation testing.


RESEARCH INTERESTS
======

🤖 AI System Engineering
------

Assure human-centric, system-level and multi-dimension trustworthy AI (e.g., fairness, safety, security, robustness, privacy, explainability, interpretability, transparency and accountability) across the full AI system engineering lifecyle (e.g., develop, train, test, deploy and monitor).

🚗 Automatic Driving System and Simulation Testing
------

The autonomous driving system is mainly composed of modules such as perception, prediction, decision-making, planning, and control. Testing the autonomous driving system in a simulator can greatly reduce the testing cost and accelerate the testing work. To this end, research on simulation testing and evaluation of autonomous driving systems has been carried out. Specifically, it includes: 1) Simulation scenario construction based on a six-layer scenario model, aiming to generate a variety of simulation test scenarios; 2) Simulation scenario reproduction driven by real scenarios, aiming to reproduce simulation test scenarios using real traffic accident reports; 3) Autonomous driving system testing based on fuzzy testing, aiming to generate simulation test scenarios that violate traffic rules or cause collisions; 4) Automatic diagnosis and problem location of simulation test results, aiming to quickly determine the responsibility and locate the defective modules in the autonomous driving system; 5) A simulation test platform that supports multi-agent interaction and vehicle-road-cloud design, aiming to support the evaluation of multi-intelligent driving systems and the simulation of vehicle-road-cloud.

HOBBIES
